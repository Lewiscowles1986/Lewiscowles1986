### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving existing testing and architecture, improving outcomes on tech projects [@techlete](https://github.com/techlete), I'm the owner of [@CODESIGN2](https://github.com/CODESIGN2) and I work at a UK startup / accelerator specialising in finance and technology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about patience, persistence, advanced disaster recovery and compassionate, effective communication.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on OpenSource Libre projects, that respect the users as much as the dev team.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with patience, compassionate and effective communication, commercial opportunities to deliver value.
- 💬 Ask me about risk, improving reliability and lowering downtime, linux and my favourity projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: open an issue or submit a PR, preferably both in-order given.
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him or anything neutral.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Computers are not magic boxes. They are applied physics through (often commodity A.K.A mass-market) engineering. You need to set boundaries if you want to do cool things.
