- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about patience, persistence, advanced disaster recovery and compassionate, effective communication.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on OpenSource Libre projects, that respect the users as much as the dev team.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with patience, compassionate and effective communication, commercial opportunities to deliver value.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about risk, improving reliability and lowering downtime, linux and my favourity projects.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: open an issue or submit a PR, preferably both in-order given.
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him or anything neutral.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Computers are not magic boxes. They are applied physics through (often commodity A.K.A mass-market) engineering. You need to set boundaries if you want to do cool things.
